<h1>A85-Allman</h1>

A version of William Colley's A85 8085 assembler, modified to provide
a reduced version of the instruction set to suit the Cisc-8 processor.

with thanks to Herb Johnson

1) used as per the original A85.DOC it operates unchanged
2) used with the parameter -o it assembles only the Cisc-8 instructions,
   other 8085 instructions are opcode errors
   
Note: I have made significant style changes to the code but not altered
the code itself. I prefer the Allman style...
